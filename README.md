# Dice-Roll

<h3>This is a basic dice roll game without any Graphical interface.</h3>
<p>Here I used two dice to play the game.<br>And if both dice's give value 6 each then we have a chance to roll the dice again.</p>


<p>Copy the code in main.py and paste in any python IDE and run it to roll the dice.</p>
